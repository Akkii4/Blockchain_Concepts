# 🚀🤖 MEV, Frontrunning & Flashbots: Unveiling the Mysterious World of Crypto Trading 🌐🔥

Ever felt like something's off while trading tokens? If so, you might have encountered MEV (Miner or Maximal Extractable Value), Frontrunning, or even Flashbots! Let me break it down for you! 💡

## MEV and Mempool Insights 📊

MEV targets arbitrage, sandwich attacks, and liquidation. The root of all this risk? The mysterious mempool. 🌪️

- There's no single mempool 😱: each miner has their own mempool of pending transactions.
- Transactions can change (mutable) 🔄: meaning they can be reordered.
- Mempool contents help determine gas prices ⛽️: by visualizing the current mempool gas prices.

## Frontrunning 🏃‍♂️

Crafty traders sneak in front of your swap, making your trade less profitable or even causing it to fail. 😠

Frontrunning occurs when a miner sees a pending transaction in the mempool that will likely affect token prices once included in a block. The miner will then insert their own transaction to buy or sell the token first to profit from the price change. For example, if a user is swapping token A for token B, and that swap will increase the price of token B, a frontrunner will swap token B first to profit. 🏃💨

## Solutions 💡

  ### 1inch ⚡️ 
  #### Uses virtual rates to make frontrunning unprofitable. 🙌

  Virtual rates follow each swap deal, and the swap rate changes only for further swaps in the same direction. For swaps in the opposite direction, a virtual rate is introduced, which      corresponds to the rate before the swap deal was made. As a result, if a frontrunner wanted to swap token B back for token A, they wouldn't be able to do so at a profitable rate, making the entire front-running operation unprofitable.

  ### Flashbots ⚡️

  These sneaky bots send transactions directly to miners, keeping them off public mempools and avoiding gas fees for failed transactions.🤯

## 🛡️ 6 Tips to Avoid Frontrunning:

1. Steer clear of low liquidity pools/Dex 🌊
2. Overpay gas for priority ⛽️💰
3. Use minimum slippage when swapping 📉
4. Place smaller orders 👛
5. Commit & reveal strategy 🎯
6. Off-chain/oracle transaction ordering 🌐
