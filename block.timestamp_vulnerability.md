# 🔒Secure your Solidity Contracts 



### It's a security pitfall that can cause by the use of block.timestamp/ blockhash in your Smart Contracts. 



⏱ block.timestamp is current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch(Number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC 1 January 1970)



blockhash #️⃣  is hash of given block



Both can be influenced by the miners ⛏ in their best interest.



Most ⚠️ vulnerable contracts are the one which relies on it to generate Random Numbers or where the massive funds can be compromised based on the timestamp. 



However there's a catch: If the scale of your time-dependent event can vary by 15 seconds, it is safe to use a block.timestamp.



**Advice is not to rely on it for high risk contract and better to use Chainlink Verifiable Randomness Function for random number generator.**
