Atomic Swaps ⚛️ : Swap Tokens between Blockchains without any risk.


1️⃣ What are Atomic Swaps ?

👉 Exchange of Tokens (existing on different blockchains) through the smart contracts , eliminating need of centralised intermediaries.

2️⃣ Why the name "Atomic" ?

👉 The custom smart contract ensure that the swap either happens in totality or not at all. 

3️⃣ It's Advantages :
• Users doesn't require to reveal their private keys.
• No way for either party to extort other.
• Replaces the complexity & delays of Cross Chain Bridges.

4️⃣ What the technology behind it 🪄:

The magic happens in the custom smart contract called Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC) - a Time bounded smart contract deployed across two blockchains , it's core components are :

• Hashlock : restricts unlock of tokens until a cryptographic proof is provided.
• Timelock : it prevents withdrawal of funds before a specific time.

5️⃣ Some Disadvantages too :
• Complexity of developing the HTLC smart contract.
• Are time bound , if either participant delay , resulting in full cancelation for other participant too.

6️⃣ Uses & Examples :
• Cross chain swaps
• Escrow
• Bitcoin Lightning Network
