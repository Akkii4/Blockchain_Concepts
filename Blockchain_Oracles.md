# Could you imagine a Technology which is responsible for managing Banking, Social Media, Supply Chain, Voting, Healthcare & even Global payments, having AUM of $1 Trillion 💵 but doesn't have access to the Internet and neither can natively communicate with the outside world 🤨


That's Blockchain⛓ in a nutshell.

Blockchains are isolated networks(a computer with ⚠️ No Internet Connection) but this property makes it extremely secure and reliable.

However for a network to realise upwards of the above mentioned use cases, it must connect to the outside world 🌎.

So the solution which comes into play is Blockchain Oracle.

### What is a Blockchain oracle❓
```
An intermediary responsible for gathering real world data & perform computation outside the Blockchain.
```
### Simple Example :
```
Consider a Betting App on Blockchain & you want to place bets on whether or not a team wins a ⚽️ sports match in real world. 
In order for app to declare results, it would need the data of the winning team.
```

### 🙋‍♂️Why can't the blockchain just get the data or do the computation?

> Blockchains themselves can't make API calls or use HTTP Get requests.

### 🙋‍♂️Why don't we just deliver the data? Does 1 oracle work?
```
Having a single oracle, or a single data source completely defeats the purpose of security🔒, decentralisation.

Instead the perfect solution of the Blockchain oracle problem is Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) , Chainlink being a popular example.
```
### Chainlink Offers features like 👉
```
1️⃣ Chainlink Data Feeds : Are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world data such as asset prices, reserve balances, and L2 sequencer health.

2️⃣ Chainlink VRF : Verifiable Random Function provides smart contract random numbers.

3️⃣ Chainlink Keepers : Automated conditional execution of your smart contracts 

4️⃣ Chainlink API Calls : Allows your contracts to perform API calls to almost any HTTP endpoints.
```
