# Layer 2 Solutions: Scaling the Scalable

Layer 2 solutions üöÄ have become increasingly popular in the world of blockchain as they help to decongest and offload work from layer 1, while leveraging the security of layer 1 and using it as a settlement layer. In this article, we will discuss the different types of Layer 2 solutions and their benefits and drawbacks.

But before exploring L2, why don't we just scale existing Layer 1 chains? Actually, there are some possible Layer 1 scaling solutions:

üîë ZK Snarks & Sharding üåå are L1 scaling solutions

Another way to achieve layer 1 scaling is by increasing block size, but it comes with its own disadvantages as:

- Block size should be medium in size at it effects both reading & writing to blockchain
- Bigger block size creates a more centralized chain, as only large miners with larger storage devices can process these blockchains with bigger block size.

## Types of Layer 2 Solutions :

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sidechains: Expanding Blockchain Capabilities

Sidechains üî± are an essential type of Layer 2 solution that works alongside the parent chain. They have their own virtual machines, security models, and consensus mechanisms. Centralized authorities known as Federations are responsible for facilitating cross-chain transactions.

Examples include Polygon and xDai.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Plasma: Accelerating Transaction Speeds

Plasma üõ°Ô∏è is another Layer 2 solution that utilizes child chains and further extends them to create a hierarchy. It leverages merkle tree concepts to achieve high throughput and low-cost transactions. 

Some of its drawbacks are:

  - Longer waiting times to withdraw funds.
  - Only supports basic token transfers or swaps, as limited support for complex smart contracts.
  - The ‚Äòdata-availability problem‚Äô: being entirely disconnected from Ethereum creates synchronization issues.

Examples include Matic and OMG Network, which have successfully implemented Plasma to enhance transactional efficiency. ‚ö°

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Channels: Lightning-Fast Microtransactions

Channels provide an excellent solution for microtransactions, supporting very High TPS with their low cost and instant withdrawals (if participants cooperate). No open participation as requires participants to know each other beforehand to open channel. Only works for transactions and doesn‚Äôt support smart contract & VM functionality. Users need to lock up their funds üîí, using virtual balances for faster transactions, while the actual funds are only utilized when entering or leaving the system.

Examples include Lightning Network, State channels, and the Raiden Network.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Rootstock: Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin

Rootstock (RSK) is a Layer 2 solution specifically designed to enable smart contract functionality on the Bitcoin blockchain. RSK utilizes Federations consisting of 25 major crypto exchanges to process these smart contracts efficiently. This integration enhances the capabilities of Bitcoin while leveraging the security and stability of the mainchain.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Rollups: Aggregating Transactions for Efficiency

Rollups are a type of Layer 2 solution that bundles multiple transactions into a single rollup, reducing the load on the mainchain. They depend on merkle tree structures and employ aggregators to eliminate unnecessary data, optimizing transaction size. Rollups are similar to Plasma in terms of capabilities, though they achieve less raw TPS than Plasma but overcome the data availability problem. They offer many-to-many transactions, smart contract capabilities, and significantly reduce the total block space requirements on Layer 1.

  #### Types of Rollups:

  1. ZK Rollups: These rollups focus on efficiency and speed by not utilizing smart contracts. They zero-knowledge proofs that run computation off-chain on transactions for any frauds and submit a validity proof to L1 chain providing instant finality. ZK Rollups can only share the final state of all accounts, making them cheaper but computationally heavier compared to optimistic rollups.

  2. Optimistic Rollups: Optimistic rollups have their own virtual machines and support smart contracts. Aggregators publish only essential information without proofs, assuming transactions are valid by default (Optimistic approach). Computation is executed only when a challenge arises. Transaction finality time for withdrawals can take up to a week; they implement dispute resolution mechanisms to detect fraud. In case of fraud, the transaction is re-executed on the main chain, and the validator is penalized. Even with one active honest party, fraudulent transactions can be detected and reverted.

‚öñÔ∏è Optimism vs. Arbitrum: In the case of any fraudulent transaction, Arbitrum verifies the entire rollup, whereas Optimism can pinpoint and check specific transactions, resulting in more efficient fraud detection. However, the larger smart contract size on Optimism compared to Ethereum is a trade-off to consider. Additionally, in Arbitrum, the management of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is handled by the sequencer, while Optimism allows it to be auctioned off to other parties.

## Conclusion

Layer 2 solutions offer a great way toimprove the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks. Each type of Layer 2 solution has its own advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right one depends on the specific use case and requirements. However, as the blockchain industry continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative Layer 2 solutions in the future.
